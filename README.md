# Milestone 4 : Wine Nation 

## 


As the final project of the course, my aim is to create a full-stack site based around business logic used to control a centrally owned dataset and to provide paid access to the site's data and services using all technologies such as HTML, CSS, JAvascript, Python, Django, relational databases and Stripe payments.

The project is an Ecommerce site for a wine shop specializing in Eastern European wines, which also has a subscription-based wine delivery service that allows shoppers to purchase wines at a better price than buying individual bottles, the longer the subscription period the lower the price per bottle.
